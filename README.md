# Non-Sense Correlations

Correlation is not causation

So, why not take it to extreme levels while practicing Python?

Each file will have two datasets with the same time range, but one dataset doesn't have anything to do with the other.
In the end, I'll show if the correlation between them is Strong, Weak, or None.
